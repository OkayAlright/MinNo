   Overview:
    - Strongly typed.

    - All statements end with ";"
    
    - By default all values are immutable.
    
    - function declares require a type signature:
    
        * type sig = a list of args and their types followed
	   by a "->" and then the return type.
	   
        * example: define sum_list([num_lst:Array[Int]] -> Int){ }

     - single statements can be made in direct c by calling "raw_c" and
        passing it a string of the needed C code.

     - functions are invoked by ML/F# syntax:
     
         * <function_name> <values seperated by spaces>

         * example: sumList [1,2,3,4,5] ;

    - "mutable" is a wrapper which will decode values in mutable memory.

    - Functions return mutable data types by default so they can be stored in
       dynamic memory.

let list_of_pins : array[int] = [1,2,3,4,5] ;  // stored in program mem (immutable)
let  on : mutable int = 7 * 8 - 5 ;       // a dynamically stored variable (mutable)


def turn_pattern pattern:int, mode:int -> int {
    // Turns pins on/off from two different patterns.
    
    let pattern1 : array[int] = [1,2,3,5];
    let pattern2 : array[int] = [3,6];
    
    if pattern == 1 {
        setPins mode pattern1;
    }
    if pattern == 2  {
        setPins mode pattern2;
    }
}
