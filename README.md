# MinNo 

MiNo is a MINimal NOise language for Arduino and AVR processors.
The languages is currently under development as part of a 
Marlboro College Plan of Concentration. 

# Example Code:

     #/
     blink.minno
     by Logan Davis
     
        An example blink program.
        
     /#
     
     let outputPin : int = 13; //set pin for reference
     
     def setup none -> none {
         //set mode to output
         pinMode outputPin OUTPUT;
     }
     
     def loop none -> none {
         // blink on and off with 1 sec intervals
         digitalWrite outputPin HIGH;
         delay 1000;
         digitalWrite outputPin LOW;
     }
     

# Why MinNo?

I didn't have an easy time learning how to code when I first started. One of the largest reasons I had trouble was 
because of my first language: [Python](https://www.python.org/).

Though Python has many strengths, I would not say consistency is not among them. This is a pervasive problem from 
the language's core mechanics (string methods being in place or returning new strings for example) to how any two 
given people try to teach the same idea (take these two answers to similar questions for example: [1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/402504/how-to-determine-the-variable-type-in-python) & [2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/402504/how-to-determine-the-variable-type-in-python)). 
One of Python's strengths is that it allows you to do one specific thing in ten different ways, but I am someone 
who likes to hear a single thing explained multiple ways. Though I was able to overcome my problems with Python, 
when I began toying around with the [Arduino platform](https://www.arduino.cc/), I found the same 
problem with their [home-grown language](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage).

The [Arduino language](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/) (AKA [Processing](http://playground.arduino.cc/Interfacing/Processing), [Wiring](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/09/07/introducing-arduino-wiring-on-windows-10-iot-core/#vYEu3yjHXGsS9ZXE.97), [C/C++](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=45492.0)) is a language built on top of C++ but only implements a 
subset of the C standard library (but none of C++'s library, just using it's syntax and constructs). There are also 
a fair amount of Arduino/AVR specific functions and global variables sprinkled about. Because of this mash up that is 
supposed to be a beginner platform and a collection of C functions resembling a K&R era implementation of the language, you 
get coders running the gamut in style and techniques. [On one end you have some hobbyists making really high level 
sketches with sophisticated libraries to run wifi-shields for their Arduino Uno project in just a few lines of 
code](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoWiFiShield101). [On the other side you have some old school hackers writing some of the most PreProcessor-Macro'ed, bit 
twiddling, interrupt throwing files you could imagine](http://rcarduino.blogspot.com/2012/11/quick-and-dirty-synth-for-arduino-due.html). If you aren't brought up to speed on C and Arduino by 
some guide that was provided by education companies like [Sparkfun](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Kits/SFE03-0012-SIK.Guide-300dpi-01.pdf), you can find yourself in a 
hexadecimal-encoded hell within a matter of clicks. MinNo is an attempt to create a more humane (for people like 
myself) entry point to the Arduino platform.

## Harvard vs. Von Neumann
Most interest in processor architecture lies in standardized implementations (x86 and ARM). The conversation 
at this level typically is a discussion of instruction sets and bus implementation. AVR processors take it a step further 
back and discuss the basic organization of a computer. X86 and ARM architectures are organized in a manner originally 
specified by [John Von Neumann](http://www.c-jump.com/CIS77/CPU/VonNeumann/lecture.html): a central processing unit, memory, some form of input, some form of output, and long term 
storage across a set of shared buses. AVR processors (generally) are organized in a manner consistent with [Harvard specification](http://embeddedknowledge.blogspot.com/2010/02/processor-architectures-harvard-von.html) (more accurately, 
the modified-Harvard spec). The main difference between Von Neumann and Harvard is that Harvard separates memory into 
two different pools: instruction memory and data memory, which attach to the CPU via entirely separate buses. 
Harvard processors can simultaneously read and write to both memory pools because they do not share a bus. The two pools 
don't even need to be indexed and architectured the same. Often (as is the case with AVR processors), instruction memory is read/write 
accessible at runtime, data memory isn't. Data memory is often used for long-term, initialization data: tables, addresses, 
arrays, keys, and so on. Both the data and instruction memory pools are implemented as EPROM/Flash storage . 
AVR processors have general SRAM for data that needs to be accessed more quickly (in place of caches).

One of the problems with using C to program Harvard processors is that most C compiler implementations (and subsequently Arduino's 
language) have grown under the ideas of Von Neumann architecture. All memory accessors and management systems, property 
files, and object oriented idioms assume the computer they are running on has one shared pool of read/write memory. To 
allow the benefits of Harvard's memory architecture, we have to pollute the global name space with keywords to specifically 
access the data memory pool (such as declaration containing "const PROGMEM" is Arduino sketches).

MinNo is an attempt to embedded Harvard's  distinction in architecture at the syntactic level. By default, all 
declarations of variables are immutable unless they contain the "mutable" tag. If the compiler sees an immutable 
declaration, it will be put in "program memory" (Arduino's name for data memory). This allows for a more concise 
memory placement syntax to counteract MinNo's slightly more verbose declaration structure. This thought of embedding 
Harvards design choices in the syntax is a consideration throughout the languages idioms and structures.

## Static Memory Allocation
[Culturally, among novice programers, pointers and manual memory management stand as the mysterious and often frightening 
figure when writing software](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4025768/what-do-people-find-difficult-about-c-pointers). It is easy to misuse them and hard to figure out why they aren't working (if you aren't 
practiced in debugging them). Their inclusion in the Arduino language stands as an oddity to me for that reason, other than 
performance restrictions that prohibit a garbage collection system. Why would a platform bragging about beginner friendliness 
use one of the most notoriously confusing memory management systems? Given that garbage collection is out of the question 
due to the lower power CPUs found on Arduinos and that MinNo is supposed to be an alternative beginner language, I have decided (at least 
for now) to have no dynamically growing memory in MinNo: everything is statically allocated.

This may initially seem like a huge drawback, and in general programming I would agree. But in embedded systems, dynamic 
memory bugs can be subtle, incredibly hard to reproduce, and absolutely system crashing . Early in my 
time programming sketches, I swore off the use of malloc and free in favor of static memory declarations. From 
synthesizers, to controllers, to IR navigating robots, I have gotten away without using dynamic heap allocations. 
To anyone reading this, for your sanity, I would suggest a similar shift in coding style. [Others also suggest minimizing dynamic 
allocation where you can](http://web-engineering.info/node/30). 

With purely static allocation, it also allows for far better utilization of the program memory pool. An added bonus in such a 
memory restricted system. 

## Template Operations vs. Stateful Procedures
MinNo is meant to emphasize a more template based form of thinking about code; the code represents templates operating on 
data. A hard separation of data and code should be taken where it can. Intermediary values and indexing values are, of 
course, held in read/write instruction memory, but these values can be thought of as markers and states in templates. 
Indexes are markers as to what templates are being applied to. Intermediate values are states in between templates 
operations. This mind set keep the separation of memory pools more consistently present and should lead one to 
minimize stateful code as to avoid unnecessary complexity.

## Getting Under The Hood
Now there are absolutely times when this distinction of memory can be far more of a hinderance than a benefit. Sometimes we 
really need manual heap allocation. MinNo's compiler attempts to generate (subjectively) readable, tabbed 
C code. This will allow boiler plate functions and code to be generated, but the resulting code can be opened and 
optimized/altered to allow for malloc's, free's and a things C-like. It also allows for a bridge from those who have 
been using MinNo to transition into C in a low-stakes, take-it-at-your-pace manner.


## The State of The Code:

Currently this project is under V0.1 development and can be considered,
for all intents and purposes, non-functional at this time. This status will
change in the very near future. :)

## What's What:

* "src/": The source code for the actual compiler is contained within this directory. The lexer, parser-spec, and translator can all be found there.
* "example/": Some example programs in MinNo.
* "resource/": Would be better titled "lib" because it just hold some files that the compiler needs. Expect that name to change.

This compiler was started on Racket 6.6 but is currently being developed
using Racket 6.8 and the only dependency to run it will be Racket itself and 
the BRAG library (http://docs.racket-lang.org/brag/).
