# MinNo 

MiNo is a MINimal NOise language for arduinos and AVR processors.
The languages is currently under developement as part of a 
Marlboro College Plan of Concentration. 

The goals of the language are:

* Be more readable than C/Processing.
* Have more consistent forms to allow for more easily understood code.
* Simplify some boilerplate arduino idioms.
* Generate readable C to allow further tweaking once the simpler MinNo file is compiled.

This readme will be expanded as the project progresses.
