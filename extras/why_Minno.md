# Why MinNo?

I did not have an easy time learning to program when I first started. A large reason is that my first programming language was Python. Though Python has many strengths, consistency is not one of them. This is a pervasive problem from the language's core mechanics (string methods being in place or returning new strings for example) to how any two given people try to teach the same idea. One of Python's strengths is that it allows you to do one specific thing in ten different ways, but I am someone who likes to hear a single way explained multiple ways. Though I was able to overcome my problems with Python, when I began toying around with Arduinos, I found the same problem with their home-grown language.

The Arduino language (AKA Processing, Wiring, C, C++) is a language built on top of C++ but only implements a subset of the C standard library. There are also a fair amount of Arduino/AVR specific functions and global variables sprinkled about. Because of this mash up of (what is called) a beginner platform and a collection of C functions resembling a K&R erra implementation of the language, you get coders running the gamut in style and techniques. On one end you have some hobbyists making really high level sketches with sophisticated libraries to run wifi-shields for their Arduino Uno project in just a few lines of code. On the other side you have some old school hackers writing some of the most PreProcessor-Macro'ed, bit twiddling, interrupt throwing files you could imagine. If you aren't brought up to speed on C and Arduino by some guide like that was provided by education companies like Sparkfun, you can find yourself in a hexadecimal-encoded hell within a matter of clicks. MinNo is an attempt to create a more humane (for people like myself) entry point to the Arduinio platform.
