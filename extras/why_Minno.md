# Why MinNo?

I did not have an easy time learning to program when I first started. A large reason is that my first programming language was Python. Though Python has many strengths, consistency is not one of them. This is a pervasive problem from the language's core mechanics (string methods being in place or returning new strings for example) to how any two given people try to teach the same idea. One of Python's strengths is that it allows you to do one specific thing in ten different ways, but I am someone who likes to hear a single way explained multiple ways. Though I was able to overcome my problems with Python, when I began toying around with Arduinos, I found the same problem with their home-grown language.

The Arduino language (AKA Processing, Wiring, C, C++) is a language built on top of C++ but only implements a subset of the C standard library. There are also a fair amount of Arduino/AVR specific functions and global variables sprinkled about. Because of this mash up of (what is called) a beginner platform and a collection of C functions resembling a K&R erra implementation of the language, you get coders running the gamut in style and techniques. On one end you have some hobbyists making really high level sketches with sophisticated libraries to run wifi-shields for their Arduino Uno project in just a few lines of code. On the other side you have some old school hackers writing some of the most PreProcessor-Macro'ed, bit twiddling, interrupt throwing files you could imagine. If you aren't brought up to speed on C and Arduino by some guide like that was provided by education companies like Sparkfun, you can find yourself in a hexadecimal-encoded hell within a matter of clicks. MinNo is an attempt to create a more humane (for people like myself) entry point to the Arduino platform.

## Harvard vs. Von Neuman
Most interest in processor architecture lies in standardized implementations (x86, ARM, and MIPS). The conversation at this level typically is a discussion of instruction sets and bus design. AVR processors take it a step further back and discuss the basic organization of a computer. X86 and ARM architectures are organized in a manner originally specified by Von Neuman: a central processing unit, memory, some form of input, some form of output, and long term storage. AVR processors (generally) are organized in a manner consistent with Havard specification (more accurately, the modified-Harvard). The main difference between Von Neuman and Harvard is that Harvard separates memory into two different pools: instruction memory and data memory. Harvard processors can simultaneously read and write to both memory pools because they do not share a bus. The two pools don't even need to be structured the same. Often (as is the case with AVR processors), instruction memory is read/write accessible, data memory isn't. Data memory is often used for long-term, initialization data: tables, addresses, arrays, keys, and so on. Both the data and instruction memory pools are long term storage as well. AVR processors have general SRAM for data that needs to be accessed more quickly (in place of caches).

One of the problems with using C to program Harvard processors is that GCC implementations (and subsequently Arduino's language) have grown under the ideas of Von Neuman architecture. All memory accessors and management systems, property files, and object oriented idioms assume the computer they are running on has one shared pool of read/write memory. To allow the benefits of Harvards memory architecture, we have to pollute the global name space with keywords to specifically access the data memory pool (such as declaration containing "const PROGMEM" is Arduino sketches).

MinNo is an attempt to embedded Harvard's  distinction in architecture at the syntactic level. By default, all declarations of variables are immutable unless they contain the "mutable" tag. If the compiler sees an immutable declaration, it will be put in "program memory" (Arduino's name for data memory). This allows for a more concise syntax to counteract MinNo's slightly more verbose declaration structure. This thought of embedding Harvards design choices in the syntax is a consideration throughout the languages idioms and structures.

## Static Memory Allocation
Culturally, among young programers, pointers and manual memory management stand as the "monster in the night" figure when writing software. It is easy to misuse them and hard to figure out why they aren't working (if you aren't practiced in using them). Their inclusion in the Arduino language stands as an oddity to me for that reason, other than performance restrictions that prohibit a garbage collection system. Why would a platform bragging about beginner friendliness use one of the most notoriously confusing memory management systems? Given that garbage collection is out of the question from a performance perspective and that MinNo is supposed to be an alternative beginner language, I have decided (at least for now) to have no dynamically growning memory in MinNo: everything is statically allocated.

This may initially seem like a huge drawback, and in general programming I would agree. But in embedded systems, dynamic memory bugs can be pervasive, incredibly hard to reproduce, and terrible hard to find the source of failure. Early in my time programming sketches, I swore off the use of malloc and free in favor of static memory declarations. From synthesizers, to controllers, to wifi-enabled motor controllers, I have gotten away without using dynamic heap allocation. To anyone reading this, for your sanity, I would suggest a similar move.

With purely static allocation, it also allows for far better utilization of the program memory. An added bonus in such a memory restricted system. 

## Template Operations vs. Stateful Procedures
MinNo is meant to emphasize a more template based form of thinking about code; the code represents templates operating on data. Intermediary values and indexing values are, of course, held in read/write instruction memory. These values can be thought of as markers and states in templates. Indexes are markers as to what templates are being applied to. Intermediate values are states in between templates operations. This mind set keep the seperation of memory pools more consistently present and should lead one to minimize stateful code as to avoid unnecessary complexity.

## Getting Under The Hood
Now there are absolutely times when this distinction of memory can be far more of a hinderance than a benefit. Sometime we really need manual heap allocation. For those times, MinNo's compiler attempts to generate readable, tabbed C code. This will allow boiler plate functions and code to be generated, but the resulting code can be opened and optimized/altered to allow for malloc's, free's and a things C-like. It also allows for a bridge from those who have been using MinNo to transition into C in a low-stakes, take-it-at-your-pace manner.
